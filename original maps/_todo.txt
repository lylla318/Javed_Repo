- color scheme fix
- crop out antarctica
- filter out the year (add slider)
- on focus in - only half page for map
- be able to display all articles
- want to see author affiliation - co-authorships from x, y, z - this many counts, etc
- articles from this many universities - this many counts


UNI X - 3 articles
UNI Y - 2 artciels 

- simple histogram? 


right now we only have co-authorship data - in the future we may have some other kinds of data... so there may be different types of counts. if someone wants to see complete list of the articles.
